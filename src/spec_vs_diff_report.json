  "summary": "Diff adds a new DSP type/options module and stage builder utilities, and updates the audio processor to a multi-stage OfflineAudioContext pipeline with configurable stages (including dynamic EQ and de-click/de-chirp) and DSP-accurate progress labels. AdvancedAudioEditor gains new settings fields for dynamic EQ and de-click/de-chirp and begins wiring strength values into processAudioWithDSP, but the provided diff is truncated before confirming all UI controls and full parameter/progress wiring. No direct video-editor code changes are shown, but a new video smoke-test checklist doc is added and App.tsx is modified for app initialization UI.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Wire the existing strength controls in AdvancedAudioEditor into the DSP pipeline so slider changes measurably change processing outcome (strength passed as parameters; 0% ~ disable; 100% strongest).",
      "reason": "The diff shows settings fields and the start of passing options into processAudioWithDSP, but the AdvancedAudioEditor.tsx snippet is truncated before confirming that all strength sliders (noise/transient/voice/spectral) are fully passed through, that onProgress is wired, and that 0% strength is handled equivalently to disabling from the UI side.",

      "requirement": "Extend AdvancedAudioEditor to expose controls for dynamic EQ and de-click/de-chirp (enable/disable + at least one intensity control each) following existing Switch + Slider + description pattern.",
      "reason": "State includes dynamicEQ/deClickDeChirp toggles and strength values, but the diff content is truncated before showing the actual rendered UI controls (Switch/Slider/labels/descriptions) for these new tools.",
