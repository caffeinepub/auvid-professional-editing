  "summary": "Diff adds a new AdvancedAudioEditor with in-browser processing and A/B preview using an in-DOM <audio> element, plus waveform/spectrum visualizations. However, requested job lifecycle wiring and “restore prior video editor behavior” are not evidenced; multiple video-related components appear significantly changed/simplified and History/job list is now a placeholder stating missing backend implementation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Restore the video editing experience to how it was before the recent audio editor changes, ensuring video editing UI/controls/preview behavior and History video comparison are not altered or degraded.",
      "reason": "The diff shows substantial modifications to video editor-related components (UnifiedVideoEditor, VideoComparison, VideoPreviewManager) including new/changed ‘AI/neural processing’ behaviors and placeholder messaging. There’s no evidence of restoring the prior (pre-audio-editor) video editor UI/interaction model; instead, new behavior and copy appear introduced.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Wire the advanced audio editing workflow into the existing upload/job lifecycle so processing produces a completed job with processedFile populated and applied audio flags reflected; errors surfaced without leaving UI stuck.",
      "reason": "Frontend query hooks indicate stub implementations for processing lifecycle/job queries, and the History list is explicitly a placeholder noting missing backend implementation. This does not demonstrate end-to-end job completion with processedFile populated or flags persisted/reflected in History/download.",

      "description": "Claims/UX implying deep-learning/AI engine and GPU-accelerated/neural network processing for audio and video (e.g., “AI Engine”, “deep learning capabilities”, “GPU-powered neural network processing”).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrained the scope to feasible in-browser audio processing techniques and lists deep-learning model inference / “supreme intelligence” / guaranteed GPU neural processing as non-goals. The diff introduces prominent ‘AI/deep learning/GPU neural’ positioning beyond what was requested.",

      "description": "Video preview controls and comparison functionality include new ‘neural processing’ stages/effects and placeholder messaging about requiring additional backend implementation.",
      "reason": "Not requested; additionally conflicts with REQ-5’s requirement to avoid introducing new video-editing behavior changes and to keep History video comparison/download functioning without regressions.",
